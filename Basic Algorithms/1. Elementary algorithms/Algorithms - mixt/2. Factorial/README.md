## [C++] Factorial number
---

Factorial Program in C++: 

Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. 
Factorial of n is denoted by n!. For example:

> n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1 = 

ex:     4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24  
        6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720  

Here, 4! is pronounced as "4 factorial", it is also called "4 bang" or "4 shriek".

There are many ways to write the factorial program in C++ language:

- Factorial Program using loop
- Factorial Program using recursion
