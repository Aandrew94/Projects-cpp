## [C++] Armstrong number
---

Armstrong number in C++: 

Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. 
For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.

Let's try to understand why 371 is an Armstrong number.

    371 = (3*3*3)+(7*7*7)+(1*1*1) = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371
    1634 = (1*1*1*1) + (6*6*6*6) + (3*3*3*3) + (4*4*4*4) = 1634
