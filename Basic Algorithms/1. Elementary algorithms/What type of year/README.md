## [C++] Check if the year is leap year or not.

Definition of a leap year: A leap year is a year that has 366 days (instead of 365).

### Example: 
* 2000, 2004, 2400 - are leap years. 
* 1800, 1900, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are normal years.

>Some exceptions to this simple rule are necessary, since the duration of a tropical year is slightly shorter than 365.25 days. Over a period of 4 centuries (400 years), the error accumulated by adding February 29 to every four years, led to an additional 3 days. Therefore, the Gregorian calendar takes into account three leap days every 400 years, the length of a leap cycle. Source: Wikipedia
